                        Since before I can remember I have had a passion for aviation. My father was a naval aviator who flew P3's. I definitely
                        inhertitted his love for flight. In the pursuit of this passion I have been training as a student pilot. My first training
                        flight took place in May 2021. I currently have 32 logged hours of flight time in the Cessna 172 including 3 hours of solo
                        flight. It is a dream of mine to develop software in correlation with the aviation industry.

                        I have been an involved member of my church community at Westover Hills Church since I was in middle school. During the summer
                        of 2023 I got the opportunity to return as a Youth Ministry Intern. Working as an intern for the church I was able to lead the
                        youth group of over 100 high school and middle school aged kids. We went on mission trips, prepared services multiple times
                        throughout the week, traveled to summer camps across the state and so much more. Click

                        Coming from Austin, Texas I was by no means an Aggie growing up, but as of 2021 I bleed maroon. WHOOP! Since arriving on
                        campus I have made it a priority to step out of my comfort zone and get involved. During my freshmen year I was involved in an
                        organization called
                        <a class="learn-link" href="https://www.fledtamu.com">FLED</a> (Freshmen Leaders in Education and Human Development). FLED
                        allowed me to break into college, and it was the first place I felt comfortable on campus. My sophomore year I took on a
                        leadership postion in FLED as well as joined a men's organization called
                        <a class="learn-link" href="https://www.aggiesuits.com">Aggie SUITS</a>. Aggie SUITS is an organization that focuses on
                        brotherhood, service, and professional development. As of my junior year, I am the Public Relations Executive of Aggie SUITS.
